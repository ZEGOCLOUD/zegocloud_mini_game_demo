And provide the following information for us to configure server authentication information:
**Application information:**
| Platform | iOS | Android | Example |

You may refer to [the implementation document of the related interfaces](https://zegocloud.feishu.cn/docx/W1uDd7oBMoVY3AxnBvYcj8IMntc).

## 2. Run the Demo
### 2.1 Server Deployment
Mini-Game uses server authentication. Therefore, before running the demo, you need to deploy the related server services. You can download the server sample code from [here](https://github.com/ZEGOCLOUD/zegocloud-mini-game-server). After downloading, you need to set the authentication information in `config.js` and then deploy the related services.


> Please note that the interface URL deployed here needs to be consistent with the interface URL provided for obtaining authentication information.
